# Socium
Socium application is the easiest way to chat with people anonymously.

You are always Anonymous, the people you chat with will never see you unless you want to! Unlike most chat apps, your appearance is unimportant here, no one needs to like you to meet and chat with new people, hit the match button and say hi!.

- Follow profiles, create your social circle
- Share your favorite spotify songs on your profile or the links you want on youtube
- Chat anonymously
- Make a voice call
- End or block a chat you don't like at any time
- No logs are kept on users or servers when your chat is over
